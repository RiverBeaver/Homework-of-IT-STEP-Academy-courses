    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p> 

    <div class="math">
      <mark>ax + b = 0</mark>
    </div>  

    <p>where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.</p> 

    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p> 

    <div class="math">
      <mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark>
    </div>  

    <p>where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.</p> 

    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

    <p><span>π</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span>r</span>) squared:</p> 

    <div class="math">
      <mark>A = π × r<sup>2</sup></mark>
    </div>  

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):</p> 
    <div class="math">
      <mark>A = π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></mark>
    </div> 

    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):</p> 
    <div class="math">
      <mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π</mark>
    </div>  

    <h2>Intersection</h2>

    <p>The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, denoted by A ⋂ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

    <div class="math">
      <mark>A ⋂ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</mark>
    </div>   

    <p>That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection A ⋂ B if and only if <span>x</span> is both an element of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.</p>
